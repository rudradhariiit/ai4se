## Introduction
Learn about the goals and scope of the AI4SE tutorial, including what you will gain from participating.

---

## Curriculum
An overview of the topics covered, including hands-on sessions, lectures, and project work.

### 1. Prompting
Prompting involves crafting effective instructions or queries to guide AI models in generating desired outputs. This approach focuses on understanding how to communicate with AI systems to achieve optimal results.

### 2. Function Calling

Function calling enables AI models to interact with external tools, APIs, or code by invoking specific functions. This approach bridges the gap between language models and software systems, allowing for more dynamic and actionable AI responses.

### 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG combines the power of large language models with external knowledge sources. By retrieving relevant information from databases or documents and integrating it into responses, RAG enhances the accuracy and depth of AI-generated content.

### 4. Agentic AI
Agentic AI refers to systems that can autonomously plan, reason, and act to accomplish complex tasks. These agents leverage multiple AI capabilities, including reasoning, memory, and tool use, to operate in dynamic environments and achieve goals with minimal human intervention.
