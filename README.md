## 📚 Content Overview

### 1. Prompting
Learn how to craft effective instructions for Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate desired outputs, including the importance of context and prompt engineering.

### 2. Function Calling
Discover how LLMs can trigger external tools or APIs, enabling dynamic interactions such as running code, querying databases, or accessing cloud services.

### 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Understand how to combine LLMs with external knowledge sources using vector databases, embeddings, and retrieval pipelines to generate more accurate and informed responses.

### 4. Agentic AI
Explore autonomous AI agents that can make decisions, use tools, collaborate, and adapt to complex tasks—featuring agent customization, memory, multi-agent conversations, and flexible interaction patterns.
